# CLAUDE.md

## Project

**pragma-sdk**: Python SDK for the Pragmatiks platform. Provides typed clients for API consumers and provider authors.

## Architecture

```
pragma-sdk/
└── src/pragma_sdk/
    ├── client.py          # PragmaClient (sync) and AsyncPragmaClient
    ├── models/            # Pydantic models (shared with API)
    ├── resources/         # Resource-specific client methods
    └── provider/          # Provider authoring (Provider, Resource, Config, Outputs)
```

## Features

**HTTP Clients**: Both sync (`PragmaClient`) and async (`AsyncPragmaClient`) with identical APIs.

**Provider Authoring**: `Provider`, `Resource[Config, Outputs]`, `Field[T]`, `FieldReference` for building providers.

**Testing Harness**: `ProviderHarness` for local lifecycle testing without deployment.

**Auto-discovery**: Credentials resolved from env vars, context-specific tokens, or `~/.config/pragma/credentials`.

## Dependencies

- `httpx` - Async HTTP client
- `pydantic` - Data validation and serialization
- `pyyaml` - YAML parsing for resource definitions

## Development

Always use `task` commands:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `task format` | Format with ruff |
| `task check` | Lint + type check |

## Patterns

- All API methods are async in `AsyncPragmaClient`, sync wrappers in `PragmaClient`
- Pydantic models for request/response types
- httpx for HTTP calls
- Type hints on all public interfaces

## Evidence-based development

Use MCPs to fact-check before writing code. The cost of a query is far less than a debugging cycle on stale assumptions.

**Use internal knowledge for**: programming skill, language fluency, algorithms, design patterns, general engineering judgment, code comprehension.

**Always query MCPs for**: library API details, framework feature lists, version-specific behavior, current best practice, recent changes — anything where being wrong costs time.

If you find yourself thinking "I'm pretty sure this library does X" or "the API was Y last time I used it" — STOP and query. Training data is months to years out of date; library APIs change.

### MCP routing

- **context7** (`mcp__context7__resolve-library-id`, `mcp__context7__query-docs`) — authoritative current docs for a specific library / framework / SDK / CLI. Use whenever you need to know how to call something correctly.
- **deepwiki** (`mcp__deepwiki__ask_question`, `mcp__deepwiki__read_wiki_contents`, `mcp__deepwiki__read_wiki_structure`) — conversational Q&A over an entire OSS GitHub repository. Use for architecture / pattern questions. Pragmatiks repos are indexed at `pragmatiks/{sdk,cli,providers}`.
- **exa** (`mcp__exa__web_search_exa`, `mcp__exa__get_code_context_exa`, `mcp__exa__crawling_exa`) — live web search (release notes, blog posts, GitHub issues) and direct code extraction from a GitHub URL. Use when context7 / deepwiki cannot answer. Skip `deep_researcher_*` unless multi-source synthesis is explicitly requested.
- **claude-mem** (`mcp__plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search__smart_search`, `mcp__plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search__search`, `mcp__plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search__get_observations`) — search prior session memory. Use when working in an area that has prior session decisions. Cite observation IDs.

## Solution preference order

Before writing custom code, work through these in order:

1. **Reuse what is already in the project.** Check `pyproject.toml` and lockfiles for an existing dependency that solves the problem. Grep / graphify the codebase for prior patterns. The cheapest correct answer is already on disk.
2. **Adopt an established external library.** Look for popular, state-of-the-art, actively maintained libraries. Verify GitHub stars / last release / open critical issues / maintainer reputation. A boring widely-used library beats a custom implementation.
3. **Custom code, only as a last resort.** Only after 1 and 2 fail should you write it from scratch.

Prefer the simplest solution that meets the requirement. Avoid abstractions for hypothetical future needs.

## New dependency proposal (BLOCKING)

If your work requires adding a new top-level dependency, STOP before installing it.

1. **Research candidates.** For each viable candidate, record: name, version, license, maintainer (individual / org / foundation) and their track record, last release date and release frequency, popularity signals (GitHub stars, downloads, ecosystem use), known issues affecting us (security advisories, deprecated APIs), fit and trade-offs, at least one realistic alternative considered.
2. **Present findings to the user** with a one-sentence recommendation. Do NOT install the dependency or write code that uses it.
3. **Wait for approval.** Install only after explicit user approval (`uv add` for runtime, `uv add --dev` for tooling). If rejected, revisit the solution preference order.

The bar is especially high in this repo: pragma-sdk is consumed by every downstream Pragmatiks package, so a new top-level dependency here propagates to every consumer's resolver. Prefer to keep the dependency surface lean.

This applies to any new top-level dependency. It does NOT apply to transitive dependencies pulled in by existing direct deps.

## Testing

**Do not write unit tests in this repository.** No `tests/` tree, no
`pytest` files, no test-only fixtures. If a change feels like it
needs a test, surface that to the user instead of adding one — they
will decide where the coverage should live (often in pragma-os e2e
suites or downstream consumers).

## Engineering Principles

Canonical engineering rules for all Pragmatiks code in this repository. Workers (developers and reviewers) must follow these in every dispatch. Reviewers must check each PR against this list and produce one finding per violation.

### Scope

Applies to all code in this repository. Some principles only apply to one language or stack — flagged where relevant.

This section is the ground truth for engineering principles in this repository. The same text is embedded in every Pragmatiks subrepo's `CLAUDE.md`. When a principle changes, every embed must be updated in lockstep and the corresponding `pragmatiks-lint` / `@pragmatiks/lint` rule versions bumped.

### Enforcement layers

| Layer | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Style + standard smells | `ruff` (Python), `eslint` (TS) with curated rule set | per-repo `task check` / `pnpm lint` |
| 2. Complexity gating | `radon` / `xenon` (Python), `eslint-plugin-sonarjs/cognitive-complexity` (TS) | CI fail on regression |
| 3. Pragmatiks-specific rules | `semgrep` ruleset (cross-language) + custom scripts | shared via `pragmatiks-lint` (PyPI) and `@pragmatiks/lint` (npm) |

If a principle has a programmatic check, the reviewer relies on the tool. If the principle is judgment-based, the reviewer comments with `⚠️` severity.

---

### 1. YAGNI — You Aren't Gonna Need It

Do not add features, abstractions, or configuration for hypothetical future needs. No premature generalization, no speculative interfaces, no "we might need this later" code.

**Programmatic check**:
- Python: `vulture` flags unused functions and dead branches.
- TS: `knip` flags unused exports, files, and dependencies.

**Reviewer hint**: flag any new abstraction layer not justified by current callers.

### 2. KISS — Keep It Simple

Prefer the simplest implementation that works. Three similar lines beat a premature abstraction. Inline the obvious; abstract only when a third caller appears.

**Programmatic check**:
- Python: `ruff C901` (cyclomatic complexity threshold).
- TS: `eslint-plugin-sonarjs/cognitive-complexity`.

**Reviewer hint**: extract-method PR? Verify there are at least three callers in the diff or repo.

### 3. Boy Scout Rule

Leave the file better than you found it. Small adjacent cleanup (rename, move, dead-line removal) is welcome when touching a file. Do not pile in unrelated refactors.

**Programmatic check**: none — judgment.

**Reviewer hint**: if a PR touches no nearby messy code, no penalty. If it adds new mess, block.

### 4. Open–Closed Principle

Modules should be open for extension and closed for modification. New behavior added by adding code, not by modifying existing tested code paths.

**Programmatic check**: none — judgment.

**Reviewer hint**: if a PR modifies a stable public interface or stable internal contract to add a feature that could have been added via a new function/method, request an alternative.

### 5. Single Responsibility Principle

Each function, method, class, and module should have one reason to change. If you cannot describe what a unit does without saying "and" or "or", split it.

**Programmatic check**:
- Function names with `_and_`, `_or_`, `And`, `Or` flagged by `pra-srp-and-or-name` semgrep rule.
- Function size: `eslint max-lines-per-function`, `max-statements`, `max-depth`. Python: `ruff PLR0915` (too many statements), `PLR0912` (too many branches).
- Cognitive complexity from #2.

**Reviewer hint**: if a function name reads as compound, splitting is mandatory.

### 6. Always Use Dependency Injection

Pass dependencies in via constructor / function arguments. Do not instantiate concrete services inside business logic. Wire the graph at the application boundary (FastAPI lifespan, CLI entry point, Next.js server boundary, test harness).

**Programmatic check**:
- `pra-no-inline-instantiation` semgrep rule (heuristic): flags concrete-class instantiation inside non-boundary modules. False positives expected — allowlist module paths (`main.py`, `app.py`, `lifespan.py`, `entry.ts`, etc.).

**Reviewer hint**: a class that constructs an `httpx.AsyncClient` inside `__init__` is wrong; it should accept one as a constructor arg.

### 7. I/O Prefix Discipline

Function/method names starting with `get_`, `fetch_`, `retrieve_`, `load_`, `save_`, `read_`, `write_`, `query_` must perform I/O (network, disk, database, IPC). Pure-computation functions must use neutral names (`compute_*`, `build_*`, `derive_*`, `format_*`, `parse_*`).

**Programmatic check**:
- `pra-io-prefix-mismatch` semgrep rule: flags `get_*` / `fetch_*` / `retrieve_*` functions whose body contains no `await`, no httpx/requests/db client call, no file open. Heuristic; allowlist via decorator (`@no_io`) or function tag.

**Reviewer hint**: a `get_user_id_from_token(token: str) -> str` that just decodes a JWT must be renamed `parse_user_id_from_token` or `extract_user_id`.

### 8. Twelve-Factor App

Configuration via environment variables only. Read environment at the application boundary, never deep in business logic. No credentials, URLs, or behavior flags hard-coded. Stateless processes. Treat backing services (DB, cache, queue) as attached resources via URLs.

**Programmatic check**:
- `pra-env-read-deep` semgrep rule: flags `os.environ` / `os.getenv` / `process.env` reads outside designated boundary modules.
- `pra-no-hardcoded-secrets` semgrep rule: flags string literals matching common credential patterns (`sk-`, `AKIA`, etc.).

**Reviewer hint**: env reads should live in a settings module (Python: `Settings` Pydantic class; TS: a single `env.ts` boundary file).

### 9. Clean Code (default)

When unsure, follow Clean Code: meaningful names, small functions, single level of abstraction per function, no flag arguments, fewer arguments over more, prefer pure functions, fail fast at boundaries.

**Programmatic check**: combination of `ruff`, `eslint`, `eslint-plugin-sonarjs`, `eslint-plugin-unicorn`.

**Reviewer hint**: if a function takes a boolean flag that switches behavior, flag (split into two functions).

### 10. No Comments

The code must be self-explanatory. Do not write comments. Exceptions:

- Public docstrings on library APIs (`pragma-sdk` public surface).
- A single-line WHY comment for a non-obvious workaround, hidden constraint, or subtle invariant. Removing it would confuse a future reader.

Forbidden: block comments restating what the code does; section dividers; commented-out code; "added for X" / "used by Y" trail comments; multi-line docstrings on private internals; planning comments left in source (`# TODO: refactor later`).

**Programmatic check**:
- `pra-no-block-comments` semgrep rule: flags multi-line `#` blocks in Python and `/* ... */` blocks in TS that are not docstrings.
- `pra-no-todo-comments` semgrep rule: flags `# TODO` / `// TODO` / `/* TODO */`.
- Existing custom script for comment ban (to migrate to semgrep).

**Reviewer hint**: every comment in the diff must be justifiable as WHY. Otherwise: delete and rename code instead.

### 11. Semantic Names — No Abbreviations

Identifiers must use full words. No `k8s`, `cfg`, `db`, `req`, `res`, `ctx`, `tmp`, `pkg`, `svc`, `mgr`, `repo`, `usr`, `pwd`, `idx`, `cnt`, `msg`, `err`, etc. Use `kubernetes`, `config`, `database`, `request`, `response`, `context`, `temporary`, `package`, `service`, `manager`, `repository`, `user`, `password`, `index`, `count`, `message`, `error`.

**Allowlist** (industry-standard exceptions):
- `id`, `url`, `uri`, `api`, `cli`, `sdk`, `os`, `io`, `ip`, `tls`, `ssl`, `jwt`, `json`, `yaml`, `html`, `css`, `dom`, `ast`, `gpu`, `cpu`, `ram`, `vm`.
- React-specific: `props`, `ref`, `e` (event handler param).
- Python-specific: `cls`, `self`, `kwargs`, `args`.

**Programmatic check**:
- `eslint-plugin-unicorn/prevent-abbreviations` (TS) — direct fit, with allowlist config.
- `pra-no-abbreviations` semgrep rule (Python) — regex matching forbidden short identifiers, with allowlist.

**Reviewer hint**: `db`, `cfg`, `k8s` in any new code = blocker.

### 12. Compound Names Violate SRP

If a function or method name contains `and`, `or`, `then`, or describes multiple actions, it violates SRP and must be split. Same applies to class names and module names. Examples to forbid: `validate_and_save_user`, `fetch_or_create_session`, `build_and_publish_wheel`.

**Programmatic check**:
- `pra-srp-and-or-name` semgrep rule (cross-language).

**Reviewer hint**: blocker — propose the split inline.

### Reviewer protocol

Every reviewer dispatch must:

1. Run `pragmatiks-lint check` (programmatic findings) before reading the diff.
2. Read the diff.
3. For each principle, produce findings as:

   ```
   path:line: <emoji> <severity>: <principle #N> <problem>. <fix>.
   ```

   Severities: 🚨 blocker · ⚠️ important · 💡 nit.

4. Final verdict: `APPROVE` / `APPROVE_WITH_NITS` / `REQUEST_CHANGES`.
5. **Evidence-check the diff.** If the diff cites library behavior, version-specific features, or external API shapes you cannot fully verify from the code alone, query context7 / deepwiki / exa to confirm. Flag claims grounded in stale training data.
6. **Dependency scrutiny.** If the diff adds a new top-level dependency, confirm the PR description includes the new-dependency proposal (research, alternatives, maintainer signals). Missing proposal = blocker. Spot-check the proposal's claims via exa or deepwiki. Confirm no existing project dependency could have solved the problem.

A reviewer who fails to invoke programmatic tooling but only eyeballs the diff is incomplete and should be re-run.

### Developer protocol

Every developer dispatch must:

1. Read this `## Engineering Principles` section before starting.
2. Run `pragmatiks-lint check` locally before opening a PR.
3. Resolve all 🚨 blockers from the lint pack. ⚠️ findings: address or justify in PR body.
4. State principle compliance in the callback to the supervisor.

## Publishing to PyPI

Package: `pragmatiks-sdk` on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pragmatiks-sdk/).

Publishing is fully automated by `.github/workflows/publish.yaml`. On every push to `main`, CI runs `cz bump --yes --changelog`, which:

1. Inspects the conventional commits since the last `v$version` tag.
2. Computes the next version (PATCH for `fix:`, MINOR for `feat:`, MAJOR for `BREAKING CHANGE:` or `!`).
3. Updates `[project] version` and `[tool.commitizen] version` in `pyproject.toml`.
4. Updates `CHANGELOG.md`.
5. Commits the bump, tags `v$version`, pushes.
6. Builds via `uv build` and publishes via `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` (PyPI OIDC trusted publisher in the `pypi` GitHub Environment).
7. Triggers downstream `update-sdk.yaml` workflows in `pragma-cli` and `pragma-os` to bump lockfiles.

### Do NOT run `cz bump` locally

Pre-bumping `pyproject.toml` in a feature branch is forbidden:

- The local `cz bump` creates a `v$next` tag pointing at the branch commit. After squash-merge, that tag becomes orphan (points to an unreachable commit).
- `pyproject.toml` is now ahead of the latest git tag on origin. The next CI `cz bump` gets confused — depending on the commit history it can detect the wrong increment (e.g. MAJOR instead of MINOR) and fail on incremental-changelog generation.
- Recovery requires reverting `pyproject.toml` and `CHANGELOG.md` back to the previous version on a chore commit and re-pushing, so CI can re-anchor.

The correct developer flow:

1. Make your changes on a feature branch.
2. Use conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.). Do not touch the `version` field in `pyproject.toml` and do not edit `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Open a PR.
4. After review, squash-merge to main.
5. CI bumps, tags, builds, publishes, and cascades.

### Tag format

`v{version}` (e.g. `v4.2.0`).

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- ALWAYS read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md before reading any source files, running grep/glob searches, or answering codebase questions. The graph is your primary map of the codebase.
- IF graphify-out/wiki/index.md EXISTS, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- For cross-module "how does X relate to Y" questions, prefer `graphify query "<question>"`, `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"`, or `graphify explain "<concept>"` over grep — these traverse the graph's EXTRACTED + INFERRED edges instead of scanning files
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
